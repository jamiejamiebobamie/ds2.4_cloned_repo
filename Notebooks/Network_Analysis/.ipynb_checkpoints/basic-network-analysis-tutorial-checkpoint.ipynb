Are there any 'sensitive' roads on the path of a given taxi which may cause a longer trip time? These and more questions can be addressed by a network analysis. \n\nThis notebook uses graph data from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crailtap/street-network-of-new-york-in-graphml) , specific it makes use of the Manhattan subgraph, because computation times on the full graph would be to long for Kaggle Kernels. \n\nAlso i would like to encourage you to check out the awesome [OSMNX package](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)\nfrom which i extracted the dataset and from which i make use of some functions. It is not available on Kaggle because it needs a Internet connection to download the graphs.\n\nThe rest of the notebook is structured as follows: First we take a look at some basic properties of the network, like how big is the network and start digging deeper to explore the generative process of the network and which roads may be important in a sense of high traffic volume and under the aspect of road closures aka attacks. Finally we will calculate useful features for the competition, like shortest paths and which boroughs it passes.\n\nHere is a sneak peak of the raw New York City Street Network!\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"61bf733a-8e70-4b1b-8e81-c90859203430","_uuid":"192943cd60bf68f688fd4a36368b4d0f7c82d7af"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://i.imgur.com/6YJ6gV3.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3688d45c-912d-4122-94d8-f6730fcdc553","_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"965ba2fd2b3f72ba4a134161d6b93f4622a249ea"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

Edges can be **directed** or ** undirected**. The number of nodes **N** is often called the **size** of the network and  states the number of objects in the model. In this example nodes are represented by way points in the OSM map from which the graph was generated, e.g., crossings and edges are roads or sub parts of roads between two nodes.\n\nEach node or edge can hold different attributes, e.g., nodes can be assigned to different types like crossings or dead-ends and edges might have a certain numerical attribute like a speed limit. Edges attributes, in the case of numerical attributes, are called weights. An graph with weighted edges is called an **weighted graph**.\n\nA first measurement for a node in the graph is the so called **degree**, which stands for the number of edges it has to other nodes, denoted by *k*.  One can also might ask what is the average degree in the network? But wait a second... if the degree is the number of edges it has to other nodes, don't we have to distinguish between directed and undirected edges to calculate the degree? Indeed, we need to distiguish between the **In-degree** and the **Out-degree** of a node, simply measuring how many edges are leaving a node and how many edges are coming in. This of cource depends on if the graph is direted or not. In the case of an undirected graph we can calculate the **average degree** by the following formular:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"df5c0b0d-a19f-4ca7-83ec-d4b436751176","_uuid":"b789dc40ff03a92fdad609a8e7c74260d72fb94a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"$$ (k) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N k_i = \\frac{2E}{N}$$"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"af2f97c1-c859-42fb-8f63-ecbe315647c8","_uuid":"3f61ff9db92b3c9962e3c3e7d7840388f8d277a7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Similar this can be done seperatly for the in- and out-degree:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7196afd5-b5b4-4f75-9605-33303d4dd477","_uuid":"a818efe3e5e3e85f0c358814b2b6f373cf85948d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"$$ (k^{in}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N k^{in}_i =(k^{out}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N k^{out}_i =  \\frac{E}{V}$$"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c32471d3-0032-4aa4-a22e-e5fb2c407779","_uuid":"16be062d103194298484a26ffdccde7bca3feaa0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"because $$k_i = k^{out}_i  + k^{in}_i  $$"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5172adf7-3940-4e3c-9814-779149428ceb","_uuid":"3b2c67783af8868c2618065f9681e89eea5fb534"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's have a first look at the network (or you can call it graph) and the basic properties of it.

Because our Network is the Manhattan Street Network and one property of it is that it contains one-way streets which can only be modeled as directed edges.

How does this influences the **robustness** of the network in a sense that what happens if specific roads are closed, how does this influnces the traffic flow?\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a04ede8d-be83-47a4-ae31-348c594fe147","_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"860106de97d0ad37f4f2257ffe689f00ff8e22c9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4.

Well, there is no 'one' or 'right' defintion of community, because it really depends on the kind of graph you want to analyse and what question you want to answer. A common definition based on the graphs structure is, that a community is a group of nodes which are higly connected within this group, but are less connected to other nodes which are not in this group. But as said this is not the only definition you can use, sometimes you can define communities based on a given node attribute or a combination of both, graph based and attributes. \n\nFor this section we will use the infamous [Zachary's karate club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club) network, because it is less computional expensive and also very easy to draw.
